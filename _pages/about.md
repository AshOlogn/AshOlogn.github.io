About Me
======
I'm a third-year undergrad at UT Austin interested in machine learning (specifically natural language processing and computer vision), and pure mathematics (differential geometry). I have research experience in tweet classification, neuroevolution applied to navigation, and--more recently--text style transfer.

This summer I will be remotely interning for the Uber Advanced Technology Group (its autonomous driving division) as a software engineer on the Predictions team, as well as continuing my NLP research.
